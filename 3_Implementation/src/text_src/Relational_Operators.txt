										Relational Operators
	
	The following table shows all the relational operators supported by C language.
    Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20 then -

 Operator:	    Description:	             
   ==	   Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not. If yes, then the condition becomes true. 
   !=	   Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not. If the values are not equal, then the
           condition becomes true.	
   >	   Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand. If yes, then
           the condition becomes true.	
   <	   Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand. If yes, then the 
           condition becomes true.
   >=	   Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand. 
           If yes, then the condition becomes true.	
   <=	   Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand. 
           If yes, then the condition becomes true.
        
		Example:
		(A == B) is not true.
        (A != B) is true.
        (A > B) is not true.
        (A < B) is true.
        (A >= B) is not true.
        (A <= B) is true.



               Example
     Try the following example to understand all the relational operators available in C -

     #include <stdio.h>

      main() {

       int a = 21;
       int b = 10;
       int c ;

       if( a == b ) {
      printf("Line 1 - a is equal to b\n" );
       } else {
      printf("Line 1 - a is not equal to b\n" );
        }
	
      if ( a < b ) {
      printf("Line 2 - a is less than b\n" );
      } else {
      printf("Line 2 - a is not less than b\n" );
       }
	
      if ( a > b ) {
      printf("Line 3 - a is greater than b\n" );
      } else {
      printf("Line 3 - a is not greater than b\n" );
      }
   
      /* Lets change value of a and b */
       a = 5;
       b = 20;
	
      if ( a <= b ) {
      printf("Line 4 - a is either less than or equal to  b\n" );
      }
	
       if ( b >= a ) {
       printf("Line 5 - b is either greater than  or equal to b\n" );
       }
       }
